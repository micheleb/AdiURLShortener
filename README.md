AdiURLShortener
===============

A plugin for Adium to shorten long URLs automatically as you type them.

Only URLs starting with 'http' or 'https' are shortened; you can set whether URLs you send or receive (or both) must be shortened, you can choose the minimum length for URLs to be shortened and set whether you want URLs pointing to images shortened: by default they're not, so this plugin doesn't conflict with the awesome Adinline plugin (http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&xtra_id=7926).
